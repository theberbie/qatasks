<h2> Please do not hesitate to ask a lead if you have any questions. /n
Below are some frequently asked questions that may answer a quick question. </h2>

<ul>

  <li> <strong> Do I need to create a bug for every issue I see? </strong> </li>
  <i> The short answer is yes. We want our users to have a seamless experience. However, please make sure to check with your team via skype to make sure there are no duplicates.</i>
<br />
 <li> <strong> My lead put me on 'Adhoc duty', what does that mean? </strong> </li>

 <i> Great job! Your team finished a project and needs you to go over the game another time to triple-check that there is no bug hiding! </i>
<br />
<li> <strong> Oh no! I just realized I sent a bug without adding the details!</strong> </li>
<i> Alright, so that's not a question. No need to panic though. Our dev team understands mistakes happen, so just go ahead and add a quick comment to explain your error, assign to yourself, and close </i>
